## Statistical Computing Project: C++ Implementation of GuanRank  
* Synopsis: We implemented GuanRank (Non-parametric algorithm to transform censored survival data to hazard ranks) in C++
to improve computational speed and memory efficiency. Our C++ version vastly outperforms a python implementation of GuanRank.

## Longitudinal and Correlated Data Analysis: Analyzing Longitudinal Student Grades Using a Mixed Effects Model  
* Synopsis: We wanted to identify factors affecting middle school student math scores over their three years. To account for correlated
outcomes, we implemented a linear mixed effects model with a random intercept and slope.

## Bayesian Inference Project: Analyzing Bike Rental Data using a Bayesian Framework  
* Synopsis: We wanted to identify factors affecting the number of bike rentals in Washington DC. Using a bayesian framework, we implemented
a poisson regression with a spike and slab prior to perform variable selection by inspecting the posterior means for each predictor.
