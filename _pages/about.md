Hi! 

My name is Kevin Liao and I'm currently a PhD Candidate in Biostatistics at the University of Michigan. I work with Dr Sebastian ZÃ¶llner developing novel methods to study genetic architecture of complex traits across diverse human populations and with Drs Mike Boehnke and Laura Scott on rare-variant testing for Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disease in admixed African Americans. A broad summary of my research interests is uncovering how genetic architecture differs across complex traits and ancestral populations and how this information can ultimately be used to optimize polygenic risk prediction of diseases and traits. 

Originally from Chapel Hill, North Carolina I moved to Ann Arbor to pursue my graduate studies. In my free time I enjoy playing tennis, basketball, golf, and soccer. I'm also active in my local church, read science fiction/fantasy novels, and am learning how to play the guitar.
