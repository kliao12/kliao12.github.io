Hi! 

My name is Kevin Liao and I'm a bioinformatics scientist at RTI International. Here, I work on a variety of contracts and R01-type grants performing statistical genetic analysis (GWAS, meta-analysis, PRS) of phenotypes including: HIV acquisition, HTLV-II, histologic breast features, and pulmonary lung function decline in diverse populations. I further integrate various omics data including metabolomics, methylation, and gene expression to provide translation insights into phenotype etiology.  

Previously, I finished my PhD in Biostatistics at the University of Michigan in 2023. Working with Dr Sebastian ZÃ¶llner, my research interests broadly focused on population genetics and methods development for studying genetic architecture across diverse populations and complex traits. I also worked with Drs Mike Boehnke and Laura Scott on rare-variant testing for Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disease in admixed African Americans.

Now residing in Brooklyn NYC (NC -> MI -> NY), in my free time I enjoy playing sports such as tennis, basketball, golf, and soccer. I also enjoy reading science fiction/fantasy novels and am learning how to play the guitar. 

I'm always happy to connect with people, so feel free to reach out via email at: ksliao@umich.edu
