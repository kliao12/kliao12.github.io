Welcome! My name is Kevin Liao and I am currently a PhD Candidate in Biostatistics at the University of Michigan. I currently work with Dr Sebastian ZÃ¶llner developing novel methods to study genetic architecture of complex traits across diverse human populations and with Drs Mike Boehnke and Laura Scott on rare-variant testing for Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disease in admixed African Americans. A broad summary of my research interests is uncovering how genetic architecture differs across ancestral populations and how this information can ultimately optimize polygenic risk prediction of diseases and phenotypes. 

In my free time I enjoy staying physicall active while playing tennis, basketball, golf, and soccer. I also enjoy reading science fiction/fantasy novels and am learning how to play the guitar.
