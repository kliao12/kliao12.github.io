Hi! 

My name is Kevin Liao and I'm currently a PhD Candidate in Biostatistics at the University of Michigan and am aiming to graduate in August 2023. I am a former [T32 Genome Science Training Program Fellow](https://sph.umich.edu/csg/gstp.html) (2018-2020) and received training at the interface of statistical, computational, and molecular genetics.

I work with Dr Sebastian ZÃ¶llner developing novel methods to study genetic architecture of complex traits across diverse human populations and with Drs Mike Boehnke and Laura Scott on rare-variant testing for Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disease in admixed African Americans. A broad summary of my research interests is uncovering how genetic architecture differs across complex traits and ancestral populations and how this information can ultimately be used to optimize polygenic risk prediction of diseases and traits. 

Originally I'm from Chapel Hill, North Carolina and moved to Ann Arbor to pursue my graduate studies. In my free time I enjoy playing sports such as tennis, basketball, golf, and soccer. I also enjoy reading science fiction/fantasy novels and am learning how to play the guitar. 

I'm always happy to connect with people, so feel free to reach out via email at: ksliao@umich.edu
